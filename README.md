# WalkLogix

**WalkLogix** is a Python-based application that estimates calories burned during walking or jogging sessions in community parks. 
It uses a mathematical modeling approach inspired by the DLICP (Deep Learning Integrated Community Parks) framework [1] â€” excluding computer vision â€” 
to provide an accessible, low-cost alternative to wearable fitness trackers.
